## About the Project

HOG2 (Hierarchical Open Graph 2) is a collection of classes and a tile-based simulator which are designed as a simple model of RTS and other clocked simulation environments. 

Documentation (much of it older, but starting to be updated) [is available here](https://movingai.com/hog2/).

### Installation

To build the project, you must first download the source code:
`$ git clone https://github.com/nathansttt/hog2.git`

Then traverse to the build directory with:
```sh
cd hog2/build/gmake
```

Finally build the project with make:
```sh
make
```

After this completes the binaries can be found under `../../bin/release/`. To fully install the programs to /usr/local/bin, run `sudo make install` under the `hog2/build/gmake/` directory; to uninstall run `sudo make uninstall` in the same directory. The install location can be changed with `make install prefix=</path/to/dir>`.
